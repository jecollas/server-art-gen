    character: Iron Man
    universe: Alpha
    age: 15
    pronouns: He/him
    sexuality: Gay
    personality: Dakota
    backstory: |
      Dakota is a sort of child genius who is able to invent and improve new technologies with ease. He has always been a straight A student in school, and has even skipped a few grades when he was younger. He has a bit of trouble passing classes now because well, he doesn't show up for any of them. He doesn’t find the need to since he inherited his parents' fortune and has everything he could ever need at Reynolds Tower.

      Even before his parents went missing before his fifteenth birthday, he had been a young delinquent, using his gadgets and tools to execute pranks on teachers and the few unfortunate people he holds petty grudges against. He built his Iron Man suit because he found out pretty quick that flying around and fighting villains was just as fun as it looked, plus he got bonus points for actually protecting the people of New York. Dakota’s a rude kid, but he has a good heart somewhere in there.
    other: Dakota
    looks: Dakota has silky black hair, hazel eyes, and a fair complexion. He always wears expensive clothes just to show them off.

  jesse:
    name: Jesse Foster
    character: The Winter Soldier
    universe: Alpha
    age: He isn't really sure, but he thinks that he's somewhere around 16/17
    pronouns: He/him
    sexuality: Questioning, either gay or bi
    personality: Jesse is kind of standoffish and easy to anger, but once you get past that he's soft. He's a self-blaming, self-hating, traumatized kid but he tries to be a kind one. As his story continues, he'll start to let his true personality shine through. He's snarky, sarcastic, always ready to Fight(TM), but he also just really wants a nap. He has a protective streak a mile wide and is honestly kind of a nerd. He had just freed himself from HYDRA after its collapse, so he's a bit unstable to say the least.
    backstory: Jesse doesn't remember his life before he was taken. Maybe he was a preteen, maybe he was already a teen, maybe he was a kid. Sometimes he remembers (in fragments, but for the most part), but he only remembers pain. His memory problems persist and he's prone to forgetfulness, which is a side effect of whatever the hell HYDRA did to him.
    other: He feels like he's looking for someone, but he isn't sure who.
    looks: |
      Jesse has shoulder-length brown hair. His hair is wavy, has a golden undertone, and darkens in the wintertime. He wears it in a high ponytail because he likes the way it swishes. He's roughly 5'9", so he's not super tall but he's not too short either.

      Jesse looks scrawny, but his clothes hide a muscular build. He has a metal right arm and a metal left leg. Sometimes when he's in a joking mood, he jokes that they balance each other out. He's pale and has circles under his eyes. He has a kind of square, kind of round face, a hooked nose, and eyes that have been a topic of dispute. Are they blue? Gray? Green? Nobody knows. He doesn't even know.

  zoe:
    name: Zoe Davis
    character: Venom
    universe: Alpha
    age: 21
    pronouns: She/her
    sexuality: Bisexual
    personality: Zoe is really anxious about 90% of the time. She is especially so around others because she has Venom as a second pet. Trying to buy food for them is just as painful as it sounds.
    backstory: Zoe is not that interesting as a person, but after being hit with the news that a close family member passed away she decided to adopt a dog to keep her company. After the dog, Gizmo, made himself at home in her tiny apartment, he started to act a bit... strange. He needed more food than the recommended amount for a dog his size, among other things. Zoe didn't really have time to visit the vet so she just thought that this was normal for a growing dog. That changed after she was attacked by a crazy ex boyfriend. Gizmo stepped in and ate him. Zoe was terrified after this, but learned to appreciate the new part of her furry companion.
    other: Gizmo is the one that becomes Venom's host. Zoe just carries around hair spray and a lighter in case they decide not to listen.

      Between assassination plots and seventy years in and out of cryo-sleep, Jaime found their name, who they could trust, and their humanity. In the present day they awoke to find that they were alone. Their base had been abandoned, the Initial was gone, and there were no orders to go off of. Now they've chosen to try and wash the blood from their hands while they explore the bright new world of the present day.
    other: |
      The Initial Winter Soldier (Bucky Barnes) is the only one that Jaime really considers themself close to. They look nothing alike due to the "donated" set of genes used to fully create them, but Bucky is the closest that Jaime has to a familial relationship. They're still looking for him.

      Jaime really likes cats, and they have a little black kitten that likes to follow them around. They don't really have any kind of citizenship, so they've taken to stealing and burglary to supply money for food and such. They currently live with Winona and Havoc.

    name: Melissa Price
    character: Wolverine
    universe: Beta
    age: 96
    pronouns: She/her
    sexuality: Asexual Biromantic
    personality: Melissa is usually tired and just wants to be left alone. She gives off a grumpy dad vibe and acts as such.

She doesn't like talking about herself and struggles with opening up about her life and her emotions. She's working on it, though.
    backstory: |
      Melissa was born Mildred Susanna Price in late November of 1922. Her father died when she was six, her brother vanished when she was eight, her mutant powers manifested when she was nine, and both her mother and grandmother died just after she turned ten. She lived the next couple of years as a homeless orphan and moved from one Hooverville to the next as the Great Depression continued on.

      She joined a traveling circus when she was twelve and performed as The Jungle Girl in Edwin Bowen's Traveling Circus and Freak Show. Bowen attempted to assault her when she was sixteen, and the ensuing conflict ultimately ended up with Melissa arrested and imprisoned in a mental institution. She was eighteen when Colonel William Stryker approached her and offered her a place in the Weapon X program, an offer that Melissa quickly accepted.

      Melissa fought in World War Two, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War before fully settling in the United States with her wife and son. She was not allowed to publically call them her wife and son because being homosexual was illegal and because society frowned upon mixed couples. It was during that decade-long period that Melissa joined the X-Men and operated under the codename Wolverine until she quit in 1976 and went into hiding in 1978. Melissa spent the next forty years living in isolation and self-imposed exile until her wife died in 2020.

      Since then, she realized her feelings for Jaime Barnes and pursued a relationship with them after fighting her way through HYDRA forces for six months. They're engaged now.
    other: Melissa likes animals, and animals like her. Her mutation has given her enhanced senses and various animal characteristics on top of her bone claws and Adamantium-laced skeleton.
    looks: Melissa is short and muscular. She stands at 5'0" and weighs in at just under 300lbs. Her hair is long, wild, curly, and a brown so dark that it's almost black. Her eyes are of a similar color, and her expression is almost always that of a scowl or glare. She prefers wearing jeans and tank tops over more appropriate types of clothing, but will occasionally dabble in dressing nicer should the mood strike.

  xavier:

    age: 22 <i>(Oct 29, 1998)</i>
    pronouns: He/Him
    sexuality: Pansexual
    personality: Despite the intimidating guise, Xavier is actually a softie that cares too much. When nervous (always), he stutters and apologizes for the smallest things. He’s stubborn about accepting help or dealing with emotions. His interests include astronomy and 80’s music, though he’ll hesitate to admit it.
    backstory: |
      <b><u>(TW: mentions of child abuseand violence)</b></u>

      Xavier spent his childhood moving from one rural Canadian town to another, most recently in Quebec. He grew up with two younger siblings, his mother, and his father - the latter being rather short-fused. Xavier got into self-sacrificial habits from a young age and always took the blame for whatever his sisters did. It rarely ended well for him.

      When he was still a kid, he met a Klyntar named "Frenzy". They intrigued him and the two were fast friends. As a teen, he even became their host, under the conditions that Frenzy would protect him and keep his mind in check. All was well until one evening, during a one-sided argument between his father and one of his sisters, Xavier gave Frenzy permission to intervene. He only wanted to defend his sibling, but the symbiote lashed out viciously. Xavier fled from home, too shaken to face the aftermath of what he caused.

      He now stays in New York, doing odd jobs for money, dealing with Frenzy, and trying to act as a vigilante with his symbiote’s powers. There’s no place for him to call home unless you count the old van he bought off the side of the road. Someday, he wishes to reconnect with his family, but fears they’d shut him out.
    other: Xavier knows some Spanish and Quebecois, along with a few Nahuatl and Yucatec words from his grandparents. His voice is deep and a little gruff. He poorly copes with stress by dissociating, among other things.
    looks: 6’3” in height, strong and broad-shouldered but still pudgy. He has shaggy, black hair and dark green eyes. Lots of scars, but most are hidden by his clothes.

  zquill:
    name: Z Quill
    character: Star Lord
    universe: Omega
    age: 17
    pronouns: They/them
    sexuality: Homoflexible
    personality: |
      Z is sarcastic, sassy, cocky, and overconfident. They are known for having a sour and loud mouth that has no filter. Their brash and abrasive personality is enough for many to brush them off as nothing more than a rude and proud dealing, but a little more time spent with them reveals the true extent of Z's grey morals and the fact that they have a huge sense of humor. It's hard to earn their respect, but once it's gained it's gained forever.

      Z is loyal to the end and can be counted on through thick and thin, but they are similarly just as untrusting. This combination leads to odd relationships but with Z's uninterested demeanor and general disregard for their own safey, it is a safe bet to say that any adventures that stem from their chaos will be interesting ones.
    backstory: |
      Z was unintentionally chucked into their life as Star Lord. When they were twelve they saw someone getting mugged and ran to the rescue, but they weren't able to fight very well because of their age. The mugger in question was an alien crime lord in disguise who kidnapped Z and forced them to work as an underling.

      Out in space with no way home, Z had no choice but to learn the ways of space crime and ended up taking a liking to it. When they were older and had learned a couple of tricks from their crew, Z stole a space cruiser and piloted it back to Earth. Unfortunately the ship was marked as an enemy and shot down once Z was within Earth's atmosphere.

      Z crashed in a section of woods and left their ship behind so that they wouldn't be detained and questioned. They ran to the nearest city. From there Z began to search for somewhere they could get a new ship.
    other: Z's only possession from before they were kidnapped is a green woven bracelet.
    looks: Z has a pale complexion, sandy blond hair, and green eyes. They carry an elemental gun from their time working as part of the crime lord's crew and wear an old long red coat that's covered in stitches and patches that speak of years of use.
