dakota:
  name: Dakota Reynolds
  character: Iron Man
  universe: Alpha
  age: 15
  pronouns: He/Him
  sexuality: Gay
  personality: Dakota
  backstory: |
    Dakota is a sort of child genius who is able to invent and improve new technologies with ease. He has always been a straight A student in school, and has even skipped a few grades when he was younger. He has a bit of trouble passing classes now because well, he doesn't show up for any of them. He doesn’t find the need to since he inherited his parents' fortune and has everything he could ever need at Reynolds Tower.

    Even before his parents went missing before his fifteenth birthday, he had been a young delinquent, using his gadgets and tools to execute pranks on teachers and the few unfortunate people he holds petty grudges against. He built his Iron Man suit because he found out pretty quick that flying around and fighting villains was just as fun as it looked, plus he got bonus points for actually protecting the people of New York. Dakota’s a rude kid, but he has a good heart somewhere in there.
  other: Dakota
  looks: Dakota has silky black hair, hazel eyes, and a fair complexion. He always wears expensive clothes just to show them off.

  name: Enna
  character: Gamora
  universe: Omega

  backstory: Enna was taken from her planet at a very young age and grew up with her adopted father, Thanos. She was abused mentally, emotionally, and sometimes physically by those around her, which caused her to grow harsh and closed off. She learned to do as her father told her to avoid getting punished.

ester:
  name: Ester Mayer
  character: Doctor Strange
  universe: Omega
  age: 15 <i>(Sept. 20th, 1994)</i>
  pronouns: She/Her
  sexuality: Asexual Lesbian
  personality: While some may mistake Ester for a teacher’s pet, she'll gladly use loopholes and bend the rules to do the right thing. She’s driven by an intense curiosity for just about everything. Under stress, she can keep her composure on the outside, but needs plenty of recharge time after or there’ll be a burst of Hebrew cursing. Aside from that, she speaks formally and clearly.
  backstory: |
    Ester was born in the US and raised by her Israeli parents as an only child, with an extended family tree to make up for it. Throughout school, she did rather well at the cost of a more vibrant social life, which was fine to her, at the time. As being a bookworm was second-nature. Then, ironically, she dealt with retail jobs in her teen years. It granted her the ability to remain deadpan in the face of any tantrum-throwing customers (or interdimensional monstrosities).

    For a few years, Ester has studied at the Sanctum Sanctorum of New York. Her fascination with the unknown and knack for magic lead her to be a skilled apprentice of the resident Sorcerers and, eventually, Sorcerer Supreme-in-training. While she still lives in New York, she’s visited Kamar-Taj several times and regularly makes trips to visit relatives for the holidays.

    Outside of the Sanctum, Ester owns her own shop. With a bit of renovation, spells, and a lot of patience, Ester turned the run-down building into what’s now known as <i>The Whimsical Wizard’s Library and Curio Shop.</i> Running the small business has, ironically, proven a great way for Ester to take her mind off things. Not to mention, it’s allowed her to befriend a few frequent customers.
  other: <s>Gifted Kid Burnout.</s> Really likes moss and snails. Also has prosopagnosia, so recognizing faces gets tricky. More sensitive to magical energies than most, which has its ups and downs.
  looks: Stands at about 5’5”. Wears sweaters or button-ups and skirts, along with the leather satchel she carries around. Her hair is typically either down in a bob or in a half-up ponytail. Sometimes seen with reading glasses.

jaime:
  name: Jaime Taylor Barnes
  character: The Winter Soldier
  universe: Beta
  age: 75 (looks 20+)
  pronouns: They/Them
  sexuality: ????
  personality: They’re rather quiet when initially out of cryo, to any authority figure they can even be described as being submissive. Though submissive, they aren’t a push over, and would sooner attack someone than do something they know is not in accordance with their programming. When they regain their memories however, their quiet attitude is mainly for strangers. They can be quite open when they want to, and incredibly kind if the situation calls for it. However, none of these traits will ever pulled out unless you manage to get them alone and their memories are mostly in place.
  backstory: |
    Made in the 1940's from the severed arm of the initial Winter Soldier, Jaime was grown as a clone and trained by Hydra to become the ultimate killing machine. Their primary duties involved various assassination attempts made on high profile military figures during World War II. One of which was the mutant known as Weapon X, their battles were fierce and terrible at times, but something changed. At one point during the war, the two stopped fighting: initially because they were tired, but then just because they could, and finally because they found being in each other’s company much better than killing one another. They learned about each other, grew close, and eventually fell for each other. It was difficult, of course, neither side of the war wanted to lose their best weapons. Nor did Jaime want to go anywhere without the Initial (Bucky). He was the person who was there first, though he hadn’t been able to provide the compassion and humanity Melissa had been able to, he had protected and taught them most of what they needed to know to survive.

    Years would pass, the war ended and Jaime’s mind was wiped of all the memory it contained and placed in a cryopod meant to hold them until the next payer came forward. And come forwards they did. For the next thirty years they were pulled out of the pod, equipped with new weapons, and sent to the war front with little to no info. Their wipes made them forget everything save for their training, so if they saw that same familiar face their first reaction was to dispatch the hindrance. After a few rounds though, it was more than likely that their memories would manage to return. It was a repetition until the end of the Vietnam war where they were sent to Siberia and put in a pod never meant to be reopened.

    They were never to know that they had become too unpredictable, especially with their constant disappearances from missions. HYDRA considered them unreliable and decided to terminate their weapon so the organization could start anew. However, something happened that kept them from fully terminating and the base was abandoned. For about 50 years they remained unconscious and unknowing in siberia. Then in 2018 their pod opened due to age and complications of the metal, allowing them out into the world once again.

    Because of their long isolation, the wipe lasted longer than most and they had no idea who they were nor what they were meant to do upon waking. After they had regained some control over their body, since their limbs had been frozen for so long, they spent a month waiting for orders. When none came they began searching for answers, discovering a map of america and detailing various bases that existed there. They scavenged some gear, including a knife that they found in the wreckage of the pod, and proceeded out into the wilds. It took them two years, but they finally managed to arrive in New York with: a cat, ratty clothing, their  knife, and absolutely no memories. Hoping naively that they’ll find someone who will tell them what the next step is.
  other: |
    The Initial Winter Soldier (Bucky Barnes) is the only one that Jaime really considers themself close to. They look nothing alike due to the "donated" set of genes used to fully create them, but Bucky is the closest that Jaime has to a familial relationship. They're still looking for him.

    Jaime really likes cats, and they have a little black kitten that likes to follow them around. They don't really have any kind of citizenship, so they've taken to stealing and burglary to supply money for food and such. They currently live in and run a bar called War Dogs.
  looks: Jaime has dark hair that's cut in a pixie style with long bangs. Their eyes are grey and slanted and their skin is a yellow-tan color. They stand at 5'8", they are slender but well muscled, and they are androgynous as f***.

jesse:
  name: Jesse Foster
  character: The Winter Soldier
  universe: Alpha
  age: He isn't really sure, but he thinks that he's somewhere around 16/17
  pronouns: He/Him
  sexuality: Questioning, either gay or bi
  personality: Jesse is kind of standoffish and easy to anger, but once you get past that he's soft. He's a self-blaming, self-hating, traumatized kid but he tries to be a kind one. As his story continues, he'll start to let his true personality shine through. He's snarky, sarcastic, always ready to Fight(TM), but he also just really wants a nap. He has a protective streak a mile wide and is honestly kind of a nerd. He had just freed himself from HYDRA after its collapse, so he's a bit unstable to say the least.
  backstory: Jesse doesn't remember his life before he was taken. Maybe he was a preteen, maybe he was already a teen, maybe he was a kid. Sometimes he remembers (in fragments, but for the most part), but he only remembers pain. His memory problems persist and he's prone to forgetfulness, which is a side effect of whatever the hell HYDRA did to him.
  other: He feels like he's looking for someone, but he isn't sure who.
  looks: |
    Jesse has shoulder-length brown hair. His hair is wavy, has a golden undertone, and darkens in the wintertime. He wears it in a high ponytail because he likes the way it swishes. He's roughly 5'9", so he's not super tall but he's not too short either.

    Jesse looks scrawny, but his clothes hide a muscular build. He has a metal right arm and a metal left leg. Sometimes when he's in a joking mood, he jokes that they balance each other out. He's pale and has circles under his eyes. He has a kind of square, kind of round face, a hooked nose, and eyes that have been a topic of dispute. Are they blue? Gray? Green? Nobody knows. He doesn't even know.

liam:
  name: Liam Wesley
  character: Angel
  universe: Omega
  age: 24
  pronouns: He/Him
  sexuality: Bisexual
  personality: Liam is friendly and gentle, very easy to talk to. He has a somewhat notable caffeine dependance (go iced coffee) and is willing to tell people the secret to making the best coffee. He is slow to open up because he has no desire to associate himself with his father or the family business but will share certain aspects if he feels safe around those he is talking to.
  backstory: |
    Born to an extremely wealthy family, everything was given to Liam on a silver platter. He went to the best schools, had expensive clothes, and hardly ever had to do any work. Their life was picturesque and perfect…that is until their mutation started to show.

    Around puberty, Liam would experience back and shoulder pains that hindered his ability to continue in sports and focus in school. He went to the doctor at the start and they said he was fine, probably just growing pains, so his parents left it at that. Not too long after, a pair of near pure white wings emerged from his back, gifting him the ability to eventually fly. Scared of what this could mean for him, Liam confided in his mother, the one person he knew would understand as she had a mild mutation as well. She was able to contort her body in almost any way without any previous flexibility, but tragically she was killed in a suspicious car accident just as Liam’s wings fully developed.

    Left in the care of his less compassionate and busy father, Liam did his best to conceal his wings around his father all while secretly transitioning and finishing schooling. Just before he graduated high school, Liam’s father caught sight of his wings, now white with speckles of different shades of brown, and nearly succeeded in getting them removed to have a “normal child”.

    Liam, with the help of one of the assistants that had worked for his mother, ran away and stayed with some school friends and a fraction of them money he was used to. He worked his way through school, taking on his mother’s maiden name to distance himself from his father, until he was fired from a job for having an obvious mutation. Dejected, he walked around the city until he came across Mythic Tattoo and Piercing. There, Tien Freyason took him on as an apprentice and now works as the secondary piercer.
  other: To conceal his wings without long coats and bindings, Liam was given a necklace from Tien that makes his wings appear to be tattoos on his back and arms. This allows him to work around the general public without harassment or having his wings get in the way of his work. He has hollow bones and enhanced senses due to his mutation.
  looks: Liam is 5'6" and has an athletic build which gives him some muscle mass while still remaining to appear skinny. He has notably wider shoulders than most but that is to accommodate his wings and the ability to fly. His wings are about 13-14 feet from tip to tip, allowing him to fly as if he were a bird.

melissa:
  name: Melissa Price
  character: Wolverine
  universe: Beta
  age: 96
  pronouns: She/Her
  sexuality: Asexual Biromantic
  personality: Melissa is usually tired and just wants to be left alone. She gives off a grumpy dad vibe and acts as such. She is a drifter who has an arsenal of random skills as the result of taking on various odd jobs throughout the years. She doesn't like talking about herself and struggles with opening up about her life and her emotions. She's working on it, though.
  backstory: |
    Melissa was born Mildred Susanna Price in late November of 1922. Her father died when she was six, her brother vanished when she was eight, her mutant powers manifested when she was nine, and both her mother and grandmother died just after she turned ten. She lived the next couple of years as a homeless orphan and moved from one Hooverville to the next as the Great Depression continued on.

    She joined a traveling circus when she was twelve and performed as The Jungle Girl in Edwin Bowen's Traveling Circus and Freak Show. Bowen attempted to assault her when she was sixteen, and the ensuing conflict ultimately ended up with Melissa arrested and imprisoned in a mental institution. She was eighteen when Colonel William Stryker approached her and offered her a place in the Weapon X program, an offer that Melissa quickly accepted.

    Melissa fought in World War Two, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War before fully settling in the United States with her wife and son. She was not allowed to publically call them her wife and son because being homosexual was illegal and because society frowned upon mixed couples. It was during that decade-long period that Melissa joined the X-Men and operated under the codename Wolverine until she quit in 1976 and went into hiding in 1978. Melissa spent the next forty years living in isolation and self-imposed exile until her wife died in 2020.

    Since then, she realized her feelings for Jaime Barnes and pursued a relationship with them after fighting her way through HYDRA forces for six months. They're engaged now.
  other: Melissa likes animals, and animals like her. Her mutation has given her enhanced senses and various animal characteristics on top of her bone claws and Adamantium-laced skeleton.
  looks: Melissa is short and muscular. She stands at 5'0" and weighs in at just under 300lbs. Her hair is long, wild, curly, and a brown so dark that it's almost black. Her eyes are of a similar color, and her expression is almost always that of a scowl or glare. She prefers wearing jeans and tank tops over more appropriate types of clothing, but will occasionally dabble in dressing nicer should the mood strike.

  character: Venom (host)
  universe: Omega
  age: 22 <i>(Oct 29, 1998)</i>
  pronouns: He/Him
  sexuality: Pansexual
  personality: Despite the intimidating guise, Xavier is actually a softie that cares too much. When nervous (always), he stutters and apologizes for the smallest things. He’s stubborn about accepting help or dealing with emotions. His interests include astronomy and 80’s music, though he’ll hesitate to admit it.
  backstory: |
    <b><u>(TW: mentions of child abuse and violence)</b></u>

    Xavier spent his childhood moving from one rural Canadian town to another, most recently in Quebec. He grew up with two younger siblings, his mother, and his father - the latter being rather short-fused. Xavier got into self-sacrificial habits from a young age and always took the blame for whatever his sisters did. It rarely ended well for him.

    When he was still a kid, he met a Klyntar named "Frenzy". They intrigued him and the two were fast friends. As a teen, he even became their host, under the conditions that Frenzy would protect him and keep his mind in check. All was well until one evening, during a one-sided argument between his father and one of his sisters, Xavier gave Frenzy permission to intervene. He only wanted to defend his sibling, but the symbiote lashed out viciously. Xavier fled from home, too shaken to face the aftermath of what he caused.

    He now stays in New York, doing odd jobs for money, dealing with Frenzy, and trying to act as a vigilante with his symbiote’s powers. There’s no place for him to call home unless you count the old van he bought off the side of the road. Someday, he wishes to reconnect with his family, but fears they’d shut him out.
  other: Xavier knows some Spanish and Quebecois, along with a few Nahuatl and Yucatec words from his grandparents. His voice is deep and a little gruff. He poorly copes with stress by dissociating, among other things.
  looks: 6’3” in height, strong and broad-shouldered but still pudgy. He has shaggy, black hair and dark green eyes. Lots of scars, but most are hidden by his clothes.

zoe:
  name: Zoe Davis
  character: Venom
  universe: Alpha
  age: 21
  pronouns: She/Her

  backstory: Zoe is not that interesting as a person, but after being hit with the news that a close family member passed away she decided to adopt a dog to keep her company. After the dog, Gizmo, made himself at home in her tiny apartment, he started to act a bit... strange. He needed more food than the recommended amount for a dog his size, among other things. Zoe didn't really have time to visit the vet so she just thought that this was normal for a growing dog. That changed after she was attacked by a crazy ex boyfriend. Gizmo stepped in and ate him. Zoe was terrified after this, but learned to appreciate the new part of her furry companion.
  other: Gizmo is the one that becomes Venom's host. Zoe just carries around hair spray and a lighter in case they decide not to listen.

zquill:
  name: Z Greyson Quill
  character: Star Lord
  universe: Omega
  age: 19
  pronouns: They/Them (Agender)
  sexuality: Homoflexible Romantic Demisexual
  personality: |
    Z is not exactly friendly. While they can certainly be calmed with offerings of food or supplies, Z has spent far to many years separated from their own species. Z's mannerisms are harsh and instinct driven. Looking mainly for survival and amusement then courtesy. They have a quick wit, and it's one that can easily adapt to situations in an effort to keep themself alive, but other than that it's not much good.

    Z's reactions are wild, chaotic, and unpredictable. They've seen a lot of things on their adventures, so at this point most of the decisions they make are based purely on how much fun and how much risk there will be. Z typically only learns and retains things that will help them stay alive. They know 6 alien languages because of a previous crew, but they don't remember much of anything about Earth, like what the heck trains are.
  backstory: |
    Z was picked off earth solely for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. They wandered off and wound up in the middle of an intergalactic deal, and as a result wound up being taken off planet and raised in space. No one expected the puny human to survive in the world of alien crime, but Z has never been one to let assumptions be correct about them.

    Z stuck to the person who fed them and taught them how to survive in this wild world until their teens, before defecting (much to the pride of their surrogate parent), and going off to gather their own reputation as a sneaky speedster. Unfortunately their ways caught up to them, and they crashed their ship on earth.

    While Z was off looking for stuff to fix it with, the ship got claimed by the local government. They guarded it too well for Z to take it back on their own, so now they wander around, looking for secret alien spots, just trying to get off this accursed tame planet.
  other: |
    Z has alien enhancements that are plated onto their skull and wired into their brain. The tech allows them to telekinetically control a flat, top-shaped sharpened disk, the edge is razor sharp, and the green edge glows, which when travelling at high speeds, seems to leave a trail. Use of this weapon can be taxing across long distances or for long periods of time, so Z's weapon of choice remains a laser blaster.

    When Z is putting low effort into controlling the disk it tends to hover about their head and follow their eyeline, or mimic Z's thoughts. Z's also figured out how to toss the disk, whenever they're not using the telekinesis part, like it's a coin or skipping stone, still cutting up their enemies, who number many.

    In addition, they stole a goober and hop universes so frequently that whether or not Omega is actually their home universe is unknown to others.
  looks: Z is 5' 9" with light skin and hair that looks like it was once blonde, but has since darkened into a medium brown. Z's outfit is incredibly mismatched, featuring shoes and a red jacket that were stolen from earth sometime in the 70's, pants that were made for a different species and then modified to fit only two legs, a prison regulation white tank top that Z escaped in, and a fabric sack that was cut into a human shirt. Z keeps their pants up and their blaster and disk holstered with what was originally a faux leather shoulder bag for a much smaller species.
