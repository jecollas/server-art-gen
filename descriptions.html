    Jesse Foster
  </button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      <b>Marvel Character:</b> Winter Soldier<br>
      <b>Age:</b> He isn’t really sure, but he thinks he’s somewhere around 16/17<br>
      <b>Pronouns:</b> he/him<br>
      <b>Sexuality:</b> questioning, either gay or bi<br>
      <b>Universe:</b> Alpha<br>
      <b>Backstory:</b> He doesn’t remember his life before he was taken. Maybe he was a preteen, maybe he was already a teen, maybe he was a kid. Sometimes he remembers, in fragments, but for the most part... he only remembers pain. His memory problems persist and he’s prone to forgetfulness, a side effect of whatever the hell HYDRA did to him.<br>
      <b>Personality:</b> kind of standoffish, easy to anger, but when you get past that... he’s soft. A self-blaming, self-hating, traumatized kid, but he tries to be a kind one. As his story continues, he’ll start to let his true personality shine through. He’s snarky and sarcastic and always ready to Fight(TM), but also just really wants a nap. He has a protective streak a mile wide, and is honestly.... kind of a nerd. He just freed himself from HYDRA after its collapse, so he’s a bit unstable, to say the least.
      Other: he feels like he’s looking for someone, but he’s not sure who.<br>
      <b>Physical Appearance:</b> Shoulder-length wavy brown hair with a golden undertone that darkens in the wintertime. He wears it in a high ponytail because he likes the way it swishes. He’s not super tall, roughly 5”9, but he’s also not too short. He’s muscular and has a metal right arm, and a metal left leg. (Sometimes, when he’s in a joking mood, he jokes that they balance each other out). He has a kinda-square, kinda round face and a hooked nose, with eyes that have been a topic of dispute. Are they blue? Gray? Green? Nobody knows. He doesn’t even know. He’s pale with circles under his eyes and looks scrawny, but his clothes hide a muscular body.

      <b>Pronouns:</b> She/Her<br>
      <b>Sexuality:</b> Bisexual<br>
      <b>Universe:</b> Alpha<br>
      <b>Backstory Quirks:</b> She’s not as interesting as a person, but after being hit with the news that a close family member passed away, she decided to adopt an animal to keep her company. After Gizmo made himself at home in her tiny apartment, he started to act a bit… Strangely. Needing more food than the recommended amount for a dog his size and other things. Zoe didn’t really have time to visit the vet so she just thought this was normal for a growing dog, but after being attacked by a crazy ex boyfriend, Gizmo stepped in and well…. Ate him. After this, Zoe was terrified but learned to appreciate the new part of her furry companion, Venom.<br>
      <b>Personality:</b> Zoe’s really anxious like 90% of the time when she’s around others, because Venom is now her second pet. Trying to buy food for them is just as painful as it sounds.<br>
      <b>Other:</b> Her dog is the one that becomes the host for Venom, she just carries around hair spray and a lighter just incase they decide not to listen.<br>
      <b>Physical Appearance:</b> Zoe has short blonde hair that curls at her shoulders, she usually wears sweatshirts and other dull colors. Her dog, Gizmo, is a medium size boxer who is attached to Zoe by the hip.

      <b>Sexuality:</b> Pan/poly disaster child<br>

      <b>Other(backstory/business/ect):</b>
      <ul>
        <li><u>Early life</u><br>
          <p>Winona was born to (Diamond) Sophia Windsor and Steve Castro and lived a pretty happy childhood, she had an affinity for martial arts but outsides of that she wanted to be a chef. Her plans fell apart when her mum got sick whilst she was in her final year of highschool and Winona turned to petty crime and illegal fighting to cover her mum’s medical bills.</p>
          <p>Distraught, Sophia turned to the life foundation agreeing to take an experimental medication for her Kidney failure and in turn they’d cover her treatment but ultimately it killed her.</p> </li>
        <li><u>Havoc</u><br>
          <p>She had promised her mum she would stop with the crime and illeagal fighting.</p>
          <p>After the passing of her mum her temper only grew and she broke her promise, entering an illegal cage fighting match and besting everyone but Ryan Fisher until he passed the symbiote over to her.</p>
          <p>The two became pretty fast and solid friends and lived for a happy few months being the local crime fighters in their neighbourhood but with the reports of a massive goop monster stalking the streets it wasn’t long before the Life Foundation caught onto their act and set a trap. They sent their apartment building up in flames and when Winona went in to rescue people they got stuck and taken in by the life foundation.</p></li>
        <li><u>Life Foundation</u><br>
          <p>Under the watch of Doctor Ally Carter she was experimented on at the Life Foundation facility in New York but they kept causing well...Havoc. Once they were done with her they shipped her off to be a crash dummy for Project Pegasus. Whilst there, they lost their sense of self and amalgamated into one being, who was just there to be used. </p>
          <p>An old host of Havoc’s, a women called JJ, was there at the Trinity Alps base and eventually she lost her nerve and helped them escape.</p>
          <p>They were found weeks later by Reese who helped nurse her back to health. It took a month for them to fully separate and when they finally came round they started falling back into their ‘’hero’’ habits and became something of an urban legend in the small town. </p>
          <p>When Reese left to become a vet in New York, Winona followed. After she reconnected with her father she discovered the warehouse in Hell’s Kitchen which her mum never got the funds for to turn into a gym like she had always dreamed of. Winona and Havoc became the lethal protector of Hell’s Kitchen and used the money they stole from other criminals to fund and build the gym. They would spend their few free hours working against the life foundation which found them slowly they turned from local hero to local criminal as they began taking jobs from anyone who could give them tips on the organisation.</p>
          <p>And well you know the rest...</p></li>

      <b>Age:</b> 22<br>
      <b>Pronouns:</b> She/her<br>
      <b>Sexuality:</b> Chaotic gay<br>
      <b>Universe:</b> Omega<br>
      <b>Backstory Quirks:</b> Enna grew up with her father, having been taken from her planet at a very young age. She was abused mentally, emotionally and sometimes even physically by those around her. This caused her to grow harsh and closed off, doing as her father told her as a way to not get punished.

    Z Quill
  </button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      <b>Marvel Character:</b> Star Lord<br>
      <b>Age:</b> 17<br>
      <b>Pronouns:</b> They/Them<br>
      <b>Sexuality:</b> Homoflexible<br>
      <b>Universe:</b> Omega<br>
      <b>Backstory Quirks:</b> Z was pretty unintentionally chucked into their life as Star Lord. At around 12 they were out and about and spotted someone getting mugged. They ran to the rescue, but because of their age weren't able to fight very well. The mugger was also secretly a disguised alien crime lord, who took Z hostage and forced them to work. Now in space and with no way to get home Z learned the ways of space crime, took quite a liking to it, and once they were older and had learned some tricks from the crew stole a space cruiser and piloted it all the way to earth. The ship however was tagged as criminal, and so was shot down once they got in the atmosphere. Z crashed in the woods, and to make sure they weren't taken hostage, left their ship behind for the authorities to question and ran to the nearest city, where they began to make their way to somewhere they could try and get a new ship to blast off in.<br>
      <b>Personality:</b> Sarcastic, sassy, cocky, overconfident, all these and many more can be used to describe Z upon first meeting. Known for a very sour and loud mouth that has no filter whatsoever their brash and abrasive personality is enough for many to brush them off as nothing more then a rude and proud dealer. Just a little bit more time spent with them however reveals a huge sense of humor and the true extent of their grey morals. It's hard to earn their respect, but once you do you have it forever, and can count on them through thick and thin. Loyal to the end though similarly just as untrusting leads to odd relationships, but with their uninterested demeanor and general disregard for their safety you can bet that whatever adventures stem from their chaos will be interesting ones.<br>
      <b>Other:</b> Z's only possession from before they were kidnapped is a green woven bracelet.<br>
