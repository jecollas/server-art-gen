    <div class="content">
      <p><b>Marvel Character:</b> Iron Man</p>
      <p><b>Age:</b> 15</p>
      <p><b>Pronouns:</b> He/Him</p>
      <p><b>Sexuality:</b> Big gay in denial</p>
      <p><b>Universe:</b> Alpha</p>
      <p><b>Backstory Quirks:</b> Dakota is a sort of child genius, able to invent and improve new technologies with ease. He has always been a straight A student in school and even skipped a few grades when he was younger. However, he has a bit of trouble passing classes now, because well- he doesn’t show up for any of them. He doesn’t find the need to, since he inherited his parents’ fortune and has everything he could ever need at Stark Tower. Even before his parents went missing before his fifteenth birthday, he’s been a young delinquent, using his gadgets and tools to execute pranks on teachers and the few unfortunate people he holds petty grudges against. He built his Iron Kid suit  because he found out pretty quick that flying around and fighting villains was just as fun as it looked he gets bonus points for actually protecting the people of New York. Dakota’s a rude kid, but he has a good heart somewhere in there.</p>
      <p><b>Physical Appearance:</b> Dakota has silky black hair and hazel eyes, with a fair complexion. He always wears expensive clothes just to show them off. [Image requires permission before use]</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p><b>Marvel Character:</b> Winter Soldier</p>
      <p><b>Age:</b> He isn’t really sure, but he thinks he’s somewhere around 16/17</p>
      <p><b>Pronouns:</b> He/him</p>
      <p><b>Sexuality:</b> Questioning, either gay or bi</p>
      <p><b>Universe:</b> Alpha</p>
      <p><b>Backstory:</b> He doesn’t remember his life before he was taken. Maybe he was a preteen, maybe he was already a teen, maybe he was a kid. Sometimes he remembers, in fragments, but for the most part... he only remembers pain. His memory problems persist and he’s prone to forgetfulness, a side effect of whatever the hell HYDRA did to him.</p>
      <p><b>Personality:</b> kind of standoffish, easy to anger, but when you get past that... he’s soft. A self-blaming, self-hating, traumatized kid, but he tries to be a kind one. As his story continues, he’ll start to let his true personality shine through. He’s snarky and sarcastic and always ready to Fight(TM), but also just really wants a nap. He has a protective streak a mile wide, and is honestly.... kind of a nerd. He just freed himself from HYDRA after its collapse, so he’s a bit unstable, to say the least.</p>
      <p><b>Other:</b> He feels like he’s looking for someone, but he’s not sure who.</p>
      <p><b>Physical Appearance:</b> Shoulder-length wavy brown hair with a golden undertone that darkens in the wintertime. He wears it in a high ponytail because he likes the way it swishes. He’s not super tall, roughly 5”9, but he’s also not too short. He’s muscular and has a metal right arm, and a metal left leg. (Sometimes, when he’s in a joking mood, he jokes that they balance each other out). He has a kinda-square, kinda round face and a hooked nose, with eyes that have been a topic of dispute. Are they blue? Gray? Green? Nobody knows. He doesn’t even know. He’s pale with circles under his eyes and looks scrawny, but his clothes hide a muscular body.</p>

      <p><b>Pronouns:</b> He/Him</p>

      <p><b>Universe:</b> Beta</p>

Shortly after their arrival, while Adam was raising funds to bring Mikomi over, Adam was diagnosed with cancer. Despite seeking treatment, Adam died and Daniel was placed into foster care and deemed an orphan.</p>
      <p class="indent">On his 13th birthday, Daniel came out to his foster parents as a trans boy. He was promptly placed in conversion therapy, and after only a few weeks attempted suicide. After recovering and spending time in a psych ward, Daniel was taken out of conversion therapy but was unallowed to be himself at home. Daniel spent most of his time at a trans youth resource center where he met Beatrice Muse, a trans woman and a Master of the Mystic Arts looking over the New York Sanctum. After telling Bea his trans experience, Bea adopts him and brings him to the Sanctum where he shows an interest and talent for the Mystic Arts.</p>
      <p><b>Personality:</b> Daniel is an introvert and has a hard time talking to new people, yet he's charismatic, albeit crude and blunt. He spends most of his time reading, his favorite genres being horror and mystery (he's a big fan of Poe and Lovecraft stories). When he's not busy with schoolwork, he's reading up on the Mystic Arts and honing his skills.</p>
      <b>Other:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>When he still lived with his foster parents, Daniel learned how to play the piano.</li>
          <li>Daniel has a superb echoic memory and can remember every piece of music he ever hears. Due to this ability, he can transcribe music instaneously when he chooses to play the piano.</li>
          <li>Like MCU Doctor Strange, the Cloak of Levitation takes a liking to him and tries to keep him safe. When not in the form of a cape, the Cloak (which Daniel affectionately calls Levi) remains on Daniel in the form of an infinity scarf.</li>
          <li>Daniel has two scars, one on each wrist, from his attempted suicide. He wears hoodies so the sleeves cover them up (and he also just really likes hoodies).</li>
        </ul>
      <p><b>Physical Apperance:</b> Daniel is skinny, but still healthy. He's approximately 5'6". [Image to the Right]</p>

      <ul>
        <li><u>Early life</u><br>
          <p>Winona was born to (Diamond) Sophia Windsor and Steve Castro and lived a pretty happy childhood, she had an affinity for martial arts but outsides of that she wanted to be a chef. Her plans fell apart when her mum got sick whilst she was in her final year of highschool and Winona turned to petty crime and illegal fighting to cover her mum’s medical bills.</p>
          <p class="indent">Distraught, Sophia turned to the life foundation agreeing to take an experimental medication for her Kidney failure and in turn they’d cover her treatment but ultimately it killed her.</p> </li>
        <li><u>Havoc</u><br>
          <p>She had promised her mum she would stop with the crime and illeagal fighting.</p>
          <p class="indent">After the passing of her mum her temper only grew and she broke her promise, entering an illegal cage fighting match and besting everyone but Ryan Fisher until he passed the symbiote over to her.</p>
          <p class="indent">The two became pretty fast and solid friends and lived for a happy few months being the local crime fighters in their neighbourhood but with the reports of a massive goop monster stalking the streets it wasn’t long before the Life Foundation caught onto their act and set a trap. They sent their apartment building up in flames and when Winona went in to rescue people they got stuck and taken in by the life foundation.</p></li>
        <li><u>Life Foundation</u><br>
          <p>Under the watch of Doctor Ally Carter she was experimented on at the Life Foundation facility in New York but they kept causing well...Havoc. Once they were done with her they shipped her off to be a crash dummy for Project Pegasus. Whilst there, they lost their sense of self and amalgamated into one being, who was just there to be used. </p>
          <p class="indent">An old host of Havoc’s, a women called JJ, was there at the Trinity Alps base and eventually she lost her nerve and helped them escape.</p>
          <p class="indent">They were found weeks later by Reese who helped nurse her back to health. It took a month for them to fully separate and when they finally came round they started falling back into their ‘’hero’’ habits and became something of an urban legend in the small town. </p>
          <p class="indent">When Reese left to become a vet in New York, Winona followed. After she reconnected with her father she discovered the warehouse in Hell’s Kitchen which her mum never got the funds for to turn into a gym like she had always dreamed of. Winona and Havoc became the lethal protector of Hell’s Kitchen and used the money they stole from other criminals to fund and build the gym. They would spend their few free hours working against the life foundation which found them slowly they turned from local hero to local criminal as they began taking jobs from anyone who could give them tips on the organisation.</p>

      <p><b>Age:</b> 19</p>
      <p><b>Pronouns:</b> She/Her</p>
      <p><b>Sexuality:</b> Bisexual</p>
      <p><b>Universe:</b> Omega</p>
      <p><b>Backstory Quirks:</b> Among the citizens of the Omega universe, there lives a huge gap between the rich and poor. While most suffer on the latter side, Victoria was lucky enough to be born with a silver spoon in her mouth. She has lived lavishly and irresponsibly her whole life, and spent her days disobeying her parents in hopes of earning some of their attention.</p>
      <p class="indent">Due to the lack of good schools in her universe, Victoria went through a number of tutors, appalling each one until they quit. Bored and gifted with a incredibly bright mind, she constructed RISJAV - an AI to assist her and serve as her primary caretaker. It became especially handy after the mysterious death of her parents.</p>
      <p class="indent">Although Victoria inherited her parents fortune and company, she still continues to engage in criminal activity through the selling of weapons. Her personal project along side this is investigating her parents deaths and further exploring her father’s research, which led her to the creation of her armor. The Iron Man the public knows is not a hero in a suit, but a war machine created by Victoria’s father. In order to keep her weapons business underway, Victoria keeps the suit and her individual identity a secret.</p>
      <p><b>Personality:</b> Snarky and insufferably sarcastic, Victoria has her wits about her, and makes sure to put them to use. Though incredibly cunning, she suffers from a need for attention and has jaded morals. She’s out to benefit herself and no one else, having learnt that she’s the only one she can truly rely on.</p>
      <p class="indent">Victoria can be incredibly selfish and unfeeling, and while a hero, is cautious to follow a plan or calling that she isn’t leading. In terms of her personal life, she’s a huge show off and loves to flirt, but also a remarkable business thinker and great at negotiating (most likely due to her stubbornness).</p>
      <p><b>Other:</b> Victoria has not yet officially become a hero, and does not take her responsibilities as seriously as she should. As of now, her Iron Man persona is still believed to be the work of her father.</p>
      <p><b>Physical Appearance:</b> Your classic vixen, Victoria has a messy mane of ginger hair that she can never seem to tame, yet somehow always looks stunning in photos. Her eyes are an intense yet captivating gold, with freckles that resemble constellations mapping the bridge of her nose. She has a toned build and noticeable curves, and is not exactly tall, but not average either. She usually sports designer clothes or an on brand t-shirt when in public, and the classic Marvel disguise of a baseball cap and sunglasses when undercover. [Image requires permission before use]</p>

      Xavier "X" Wolfe
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong><u>((TWs for abuse and violence))</u></strong></p>
      <p><b>Marvel Character:</b> Venom</p>
      <p><b>Name:</b> Xavier "X" Wolfe (Symbiote is named Frenzy)</p>
      <p><b>Age:</b> 21</p>
      <p><b>Pronouns:</b> He/him (Frenzy goes by they/them or he/him)</p>
      <p><b>Sexuality:</b> Pansexual</p>
      <p><b>Universe:</b> Omega</p>
      <p><b>Backstory Quirks:</b> For most of Xavier’s life, he’d lived in a small town in Quebec along with two little sisters, his mother, and <strike>rather shitty</strike> father. At the age of 11, he met a rather strange-looking dog named Frenzy, which he soon learned was <em>not</em> entirely a dog. For a few years he and the <strike>dog</strike> <em>alien symbiote</em> were just friends learning about each other, but eventually Xavier decided to let himself be Frenzy’s host. It was all fine and well, with Frenzy keeping their host’s anxiety in check and helping him hide various bruises and scars. But, of course, Xavier’s luck soon ran out.</p>
      <p class="indent">It was a heated and one-sided argument involving his father and one of his sisters. A teenaged Xavier, filled with anger and a need to protect his siblings, gave Frenzy permission to suit-up. In short, it only resulted in the symbiote mauling his father and scaring the rest of his family out of their minds. Symbiote and host both fled afterward, with Xavier soon convincing himself that his mother and sisters would be better off without him.</p>
      <p class="indent">After a few years on his own, moving place to place and avoiding authorities as best he could, Xavier had become somewhat of a <strike>cryptid</strike> vigilante wherever he went. Nowadays, hiding out in abandoned buildings by day and taking out the occasional criminal by night - with Frenzy’s help, of course - has become a routine for him.</p>
      <p><b>Personality:</b> While Xavier’s resting face can be rather dark and intimidating, he’s really just a big softie… and incredibly anxious and awkward in any social situations. He has a nervous stutter (that he hates) which seems more prominent when Frenzy isn’t around. Despite his reluctance to really trust anyone and habit of burying emotions, Xavier can be very sweet and caring with his friends. <strike>Maybe a bit too selfless, as well.</strike></p>
      <p><b>Other:</b> Xavier is a complete nerd about space, even if he won’t admit it. The sight of blood usually makes him sick, and he’s a little claustrophobic. Hospitals and labs are also a big nope...</p>
      <p><b>Physical appearance:</b> 6'3" in height and usually looks tired. Kinda buff, though that’s mostly a symbiote host side-effect. Also has quite a few scars, but most are hidden since he lives in old hoodies and/or long-sleeved shirts. Frenzy, the symbiote, is solid-black and looks pretty normal aside from their snout and the two, ear-like points on their head. When fully suited-up and standing, they’re around 8’2”.

      Z Quill
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <p><b>Marvel Character:</b> Star Lord</p>
      <p><b>Age:</b> 17</p>
      <p><b>Pronouns:</b> They/Them</p>
      <p><b>Sexuality:</b> Homoflexible</p>
      <p><b>Universe:</b> Omega</p>
      <p><b>Backstory Quirks:</b> Z was pretty unintentionally chucked into their life as Star Lord. At around 12 they were out and about and spotted someone getting mugged. They ran to the rescue, but because of their age weren't able to fight very well. The mugger was also secretly a disguised alien crime lord, who took Z hostage and forced them to work. Now in space and with no way to get home Z learned the ways of space crime, took quite a liking to it, and once they were older and had learned some tricks from the crew stole a space cruiser and piloted it all the way to earth. The ship however was tagged as criminal, and so was shot down once they got in the atmosphere. Z crashed in the woods, and to make sure they weren't taken hostage, left their ship behind for the authorities to question and ran to the nearest city, where they began to make their way to somewhere they could try and get a new ship to blast off in.</p>
      <p><b>Personality:</b> Sarcastic, sassy, cocky, overconfident, all these and many more can be used to describe Z upon first meeting. Known for a very sour and loud mouth that has no filter whatsoever their brash and abrasive personality is enough for many to brush them off as nothing more then a rude and proud dealer. Just a little bit more time spent with them however reveals a huge sense of humor and the true extent of their grey morals. It's hard to earn their respect, but once you do you have it forever, and can count on them through thick and thin. Loyal to the end though similarly just as untrusting leads to odd relationships, but with their uninterested demeanor and general disregard for their safety you can bet that whatever adventures stem from their chaos will be interesting ones.</p>
      <p><b>Other:</b> Z's only possession from before they were kidnapped is a green woven bracelet.</p>
