  <b>Marvel Character:</b> Winter Soldier<br>
  <b>Name:</b> Jesse Foster
  <span id="dots">...</span><br><span id="more">
  <b>Age:</b> He isn’t really sure, but he thinks he’s somewhere around 16/17<br>
  <b>Pronouns:</b> he/him<br>
  <b>Sexuality:</b> questioning, either gay or bi<br>
  <b>Universe:</b> Alpha<br>
  <b>Backstory:</b> He doesn’t remember his life before he was taken. Maybe he was a preteen, maybe he was already a teen, maybe he was a kid. Sometimes he remembers, in fragments, but for the most part... he only remembers pain. His memory problems persist and he’s prone to forgetfulness, a side effect of whatever the hell HYDRA did to him.
  Personality: kind of standoffish, easy to anger, but when you get past that... he’s soft. A self-blaming, self-hating, traumatized kid, but he tries to be a kind one. As his story continues, he’ll start to let his true personality shine through. He’s snarky and sarcastic and always ready to Fight™️, but also just really wants a nap. He has a protective streak a mile wide, and is honestly.... kind of a nerd. He just freed himself from HYDRA after its collapse, so he’s a bit unstable, to say the least.
  Other: he feels like he’s looking for someone, but he’s not sure who.<br>
  <b>Physical Appearance:</b> Shoulder-length wavy brown hair with a golden undertone that darkens in the wintertime. He wears it in a high ponytail because he likes the way it swishes. He’s not super tall, roughly 5”9, but he’s also not too short. He’s muscular and has a metal right arm, and a metal left leg. (Sometimes, when he’s in a joking mood, he jokes that they balance each other out). He has a kinda-square, kinda round face and a hooked nose, with eyes that have been a topic of dispute. Are they blue? Gray? Green? Nobody knows. He doesn’t even know. He’s pale with circles under his eyes and looks scrawny, but his clothes hide a muscular body.</span></p>
